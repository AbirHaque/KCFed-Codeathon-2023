## Goal
Many home automation platforms, such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Home Assistant, allow people of all backgrounds to automate their day-to-day tasks. We aim to help everyday people that are unfamiliar with coding learn how code is used in such home automation systems. That way, they can build custom solutions in the future that solve problems existing platforms cannot.

## Solution
Simulearn is a React web app that presents users with a series of engaging Python coding exercises that tie beginner programming concepts to real-world home automation tasks. To make learning how to code easy for people of all backgrounds, we made our app user-friendly by offering instant feedback. In addition, Python is a great beginner's programming language! Users can modify code in an interactive code editor in their own web browser. Simulearn is an engaging and practical way for users to learn Python and apply it to their everyday lives.
